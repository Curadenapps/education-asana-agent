name: curaden-communications
description: This skill should be used when the user wants to "run the weekly sync",
  "sync RevolveNote to GitHub", "push revolvenote", "sync Jira to Notion",
  "update BOB in Notion", "sync BOB issues", "run the BOB broadcast",
  "send the weekly BOB update", "post BOB status", "sync Curaden tools",
  or "run the communication tasks". Use this skill when working across
  Curaden's tech stack (RevolveNote, BOB/iTOP, Jira, Notion, GitHub).
  Covers three sub-procedures: revolve-note-weekly-sync,
  jira-notion-bob-sync, and bob-weekly-broadcast.

# Curaden Communications

This skill packages three recurring Curaden communication workflows so any Claude session can run them on demand — not just the scheduled tasks on claude.ai.

## Procedures

| Trigger phrases | Procedure |
|-----------------|-----------|
| "sync revolvenote", "push revolvenote to GitHub", "run revolvenote sync" | [1. RevolveNote Weekly Sync](#1-revolvenote-weekly-sync) |
| "sync BOB to Notion", "run jira notion sync", "sync BOB issues" | [2. Jira-Notion BOB Sync](#2-jira-notion-bob-sync) |
| "run BOB broadcast", "send weekly BOB update", "post BOB status" | [3. BOB Weekly Broadcast](#3-bob-weekly-broadcast) |

Read `references/revolvenote-sync.md` for repo details and excluded files.
Read `references/jira-notion-bob-sync.md` for JQL patterns and Notion field mapping.
Read `references/bob-weekly-broadcast.md` for the broadcast template and target page.

## 1. RevolveNote Weekly Sync

Stages and pushes the latest RevolveNote app state to `github.com/Curadenapps/revolvenote`.

### Steps

1. Read `references/revolvenote-sync.md` for the repo path, excluded files, and commit format.
2. Navigate to the RevolveNote repo directory (from the reference file).
3. Stage all modified files, excluding those listed in the reference:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   ```
4. Check for changes — if the working tree is clean, report "Nothing to sync" and stop.
5. Create a timestamped commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "sync: weekly revolvenote sync $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   ```
6. Push to the Curadenapps remote:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
7. Report the list of changed files and the push confirmation to the user.

### Output

- Push confirmation with commit hash
- List of files staged and pushed
- "Nothing to sync" if working tree was clean

## 2. Jira-Notion BOB Sync

Queries all open BOB project issues from Jira and creates or updates corresponding Notion pages.

### Steps

1. Read `references/jira-notion-bob-sync.md` for the JQL query, Notion database ID, and field mapping.
2. Query Jira for open BOB issues using `mcp__cba144a5-138f-455b-8987-f84b72c3c4e9__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` with the JQL from the reference file.
3. For each issue returned:
   a. Search Notion for a page matching the Jira issue key using `mcp__58bd2daa-0ddc-4a1b-943b-fea8681cc8c6__notion-search` with query `{ISSUE_KEY}`.
   b. If no page found → create one using `mcp__58bd2daa-0ddc-4a1b-943b-fea8681cc8c6__notion-create-pages` with fields from the mapping in the reference file.
   c. If a page exists → update status and priority using `mcp__58bd2daa-0ddc-4a1b-943b-fea8681cc8c6__notion-update-page`.
4. Track counts: pages created, pages updated, pages skipped (already up to date).
5. Report the totals to the user.

### Output

- Count of Notion pages created
- Count of Notion pages updated
- Count skipped (no changes needed)
- Any errors encountered per issue

---

## 3. BOB Weekly Broadcast

Generates a structured weekly status summary from Jira and posts it as a new Notion page in the BOB broadcast space.

### Steps

1. Read `references/bob-weekly-broadcast.md` for the Notion target page ID, broadcast template, and JQL variants.
2. Run three Jira queries using `mcp__cba144a5-138f-455b-8987-f84b72c3c4e9__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql`:
   - **Done this week**: issues resolved/closed in the last 7 days (JQL from reference)
   - **In Progress**: issues currently active (JQL from reference)
   - **Blockers**: issues flagged as blocked or high-priority and open (JQL from reference)
3. Format the results using the broadcast template from the reference file. Sections:
   - `## Done This Week` — issue key + summary for each resolved issue
   - `## In Progress` — issue key + summary + assignee for each active issue
   - `## Blockers / Watch` — issue key + summary + reason flagged
4. Create a new Notion page using `mcp__58bd2daa-0ddc-4a1b-943b-fea8681cc8c6__notion-create-pages` under the target page from the reference file. Title format: `BOB Weekly Broadcast — {YYYY-MM-DD}`.
5. Read `references/webex-broadcast.md`. Format the broadcast as Webex Markdown using the template in that file (append the Notion page URL at the bottom). Check `DRY_RUN`:
   - If `DRY_RUN=true`: print the payload that would be sent and skip the API call.
   - If `DRY_RUN=false`: POST to the Webex messages API using the curl command in the reference file. Return the `webLink` from the response, or report the error if the call fails (do not abort — the Notion page is already created).
6. Return the Notion page URL and the Webex message link (or dry-run payload) to the user.

### Output

- URL of the newly created Notion broadcast page
- Webex message link (or dry-run payload showing what would be sent)
- Summary: N done, N in progress, N blockers
