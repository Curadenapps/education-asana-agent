# Claude Code — Curadenapps Agents

## System Context

Read [`README.md`](README.md) for the full system architecture before taking any action in this repo.

## Skills

The following skills are available and will auto-load based on trigger phrases:

- **`skills/curaden-communications/SKILL.md`** — RevolveNote sync, Jira-Notion BOB sync, BOB weekly broadcast

Trigger phrases are defined in each SKILL.md frontmatter. Skills load their own reference files as needed.

## Agents

All agents share a common YAML frontmatter schema (trigger, memory,
idempotency_key, dry_run, output schema). Load the relevant file for context:

**Orchestration**
- [`agents/orchestrator.md`](agents/orchestrator.md) — Master router; entry point for all activity

**Core governance**
- [`agents/truth-catcher.md`](agents/truth-catcher.md) — Notion vs Asana alignment enforcement
- [`agents/brand-asset.md`](agents/brand-asset.md) — Brand asset governance and RACI approval gates
- [`agents/asana-maintenance.md`](agents/asana-maintenance.md) — Kanban routing, update snippets, audit trail writes

**Data & integrations**
- [`agents/notion-sync.md`](agents/notion-sync.md) — Owns .truth-cache/; fetches Notion on schedule
- [`agents/figma.md`](agents/figma.md) — Figma library monitor, export validator, design diff detection
- [`agents/webflow.md`](agents/webflow.md) — Webflow publishing gate and asset sync
- [`agents/github.md`](agents/github.md) — PR/commit linkage to Jira and Asana (Curadenapps org)
- [`agents/release.md`](agents/release.md) — Release coordinator (BOB + RevolveNote); manual trigger only

## Scope

Before taking any action, check [`SCOPE.md`](SCOPE.md) for hard boundaries.
Never modify `.truth-cache/` directly — it is written only by `notion-sync`.

## Notion Workspace

notion-sync discovers all child page IDs on first run and caches them.
